% Author names
%
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph.
%
%\IEEEcompsocitemizethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted
% lists for "first footnote" author affiliations. 
% Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group.
\author{Francisco~Maria~Calisto% <-this % stops a space
% Change the Course Name 
% note: need leading \protect in front of \\ to get a newline within \thanks as
% \\ is fragile and will error, could use \hfil\break instead.
