\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "E" for an initial drop letter
% and "STE" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{E}{ste} projecto foi encomendado para a cadeira de Portfolio Pessoal IV e tem como objectivo desenvolver, documentar e relatar a plataforma que irá receber todos os relatório, trabalhos e projectos dos vários anos em que a cadeira foi e é lecionada. Como tal foi feito um levantamento de requisitos, várias reuniões com o Professor Rui Cruz que nos indicou não só a informação que precisávamos, como também quais os critérios na análise e levantamento dos requisitos.

\section{Scoring Rubrics}
The table of Scoring Rubrics (at the bottom of the first page of each Report) depends on the Report Type (ACTIVITY or LEARNINGS). Therefore, you must pay attention to have the correct table displayed when you select your Report Type in lines 21 or 22 of the \textbf{PP\_Report\_Preamble.tex} document. Failure to do so means that your Report WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED for evaluation.

The scoring Rubrics correspond to the evaluation of different aspects of your Report, and have the following meanings:

\begin{description}
\item[ACTIVITY table]  \hfill \\
This table contains the rubrics that evaluate the Activity Report as an objective, factual document, describing the purpose of the activity, the tasks performed, the execution environment, the constraints, results etc. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Intro}] This rubric evaluates how you introduce the Activity described in the document. A competent introduction should describe at least the significance of the topic and the purposes of the work. 
\item[\textbf{Object}] This rubric evaluates how you describe the Objectives of the work. You should provide clear and concise description of the procedures/tasks that were performed.
\item[\textbf{Plan}] This rubric evaluates how you planned/prepared your work.
\item[\textbf{Exec}] This rubrics will evaluate how you describe all the phases/steps/task of the work/activity, and will consider items such as when, where, how, what, with/for whom, duration, etc.
\item[\textbf{Result}] This rubric will evaluate how you describe the results of the work performed. You should report your results neutrally.
\end{itemize}
\item[LEARNINGS table] \hfill \\
This table contains the rubrics that evaluate the learning experience in terms of non-technical (soft) skills acquired or perfected.
\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Intro}] This rubric evaluates how you introduce the subject (your own experience) to be described. A competent introduction should describe at least the significance of what you have done and what you have learned from doing it.
\item[\textbf{Motiv}] This rubric evaluates how you describe your motivation for choosing and performing the activity.
\item[\textbf{Skills}] This rubric evaluates all the soft-skills described as perfected and/or acquired during the execution of the activity.
\item[\textbf{Reflect}] This rubric evaluates your analysis over the learning experience and how well you describe it.
\item[\textbf{Sugg}] This rubric will evaluate your Comments regarding the activity performed, as well as your Recommendations or Suggestions for improvements or variations.
\end{itemize}
\item[DOCUMENT table] \hfill \\
This table contains the rubrics that evaluate the document form and structure.
\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Struct}] Evaluation the structure of the document in terms of contents.
\item[\textbf{Ortog}] Evaluates the quality of the orthography (spelling, appropriateness, etc.).
\item[\textbf{Gram}] Evaluates the grammar construction.
\item[\textbf{Form}] Evaluates the format conformance of the document in terms of components.
\item[\textbf{Abstr}] Evaluates the quality of the abstract, if it is really a summary of the document. The abstract is what is initially previewed by readership to determine if the remainder of the document is worth reading. 
\item[\textbf{Concl}] This rubric evaluates how concise and analytic you are on drawing conclusions from what you have done. The Conclusion is comprised of some final, summative statements that reflect the flow and outcomes of the subject described in the document. 
\end{itemize}
\item[PENALTY table] \hfill \\
This table contains the rubrics related with the Titles of the document, file names and identification(s) of  author(s).
\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Titles}] Evaluates if the Main Title, subtitle, abridged title, etc. are adequate.
\item[\textbf{Files}] Evaluates conformation of the file names of the submitted documents with the rules.
\item[\textbf{IDs}] Evaluates the correct information related with the identification of author(s), submission dates, etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\section{Features}
This section describes some of the common features used on writing documents with \LaTeX.
\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} 
This template is ready to define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract.
For the students of \ac{IST} it becomes very easy to make references to the School just using the respective acronym. The first time it was used, in previous paragraph, the name of \ac{IST} was presented in extended form, but now only the acronym was typed.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Equations}
Writing equations or math expressions, for example $\alpha + \beta = \chi$, is also very easy.

Another method to write math expressions or equations is the following construct, normally numbered automatically:
\begin{equation}
\delta + \epsilon = \theta
\label{eq2}
\end{equation}

With this construct the reference in text to Equation~\ref{eq2} is straightforward.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Figures}
Placing figures is also very easy, as for example the following Fig.~\ref{fig_sim}:

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{soft_skills.png}
\caption{The Soft-Skills Tree}
\label{fig_sim}
\end{figure}

With this construct the reference in text to Figure~\ref{fig_sim} is straightforward
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Another Section}
Write here Some text. Note that some special characters need an escape sequence. For example, to write a \% sign you need to escape the character with a backslash (\textbackslash\%).
